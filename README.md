# PassMan
Decentralized encrypted password manager 

## CIPHER : Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) mode of operation. This software uses AESGCM to encrypt-decrypt the data, buy deriving a key from the master password using PBKDF2, where it is a simple cryptographic key derivation function, which is resistant to dictionary attacks and rainbow table attacks.
It is based on iteratively deriving HMAC many times with some padding.  The PBKDF2 algorithm is described in the Internet standard RFC 2898 (PKCS #5).
